Â Well, it's the night before I'm supposed to officially start the ride and frankly it's not looking good. The start point is Astoria, OR. Unfortunately, Oregon is under an excessive heat warning and the high tomorrow will be 102+:

Given that I may delay the start by a day until the weather returns to more normal temperatures. Alternatively I may get a very early start and try and beat the heat, but I won't make it very far I don't think. It's the middle of the night in Portland and it' still 90 or so...

Overall not a great start to the trip but what you gonna do. Will post an update tomorrow depending on what happens.
