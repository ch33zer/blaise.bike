Short easy day today. After the sprint that has been Kansas I'm taking it easy for a few days and taking a short day today and a rest day tomorrow. I woke up around 7 and had a good oatmeal breakfast with granola and maple syrup. I then packed and made sure the church was clean before leaving late, around 9. I got on the road and saw like 5 cars immediately which worried me, then saw none for 5 miles. It was easy going and since I wasn't going far I just took it easy. Good thing too, as there were no clouds and minimal haze to keep the sun at bay. Coupled with the late start it was very warm.  
I reach SR 7 which was busy and had no shoulder and a drop off on the side of the road. I was very sketched out by this part and went as fast as I could to get through it. The headwinds were brutal through here and really slowed me down. I also pulled into every driveway to let the trucks pass. I was relieved as I pulled into Girard, the endpoint of map segment 8! I'm officially 2/3 done with the trip!  
I went to a convenience store and got donuts and tea and ate them in the AC. The cashier was very sweet. I got back on SR 7 and headed south for a short while through the town; it was really cute and pleasant. I then went through the countryside for a bit before turning left onto a small road. I think this is the back way into town because it was much busier than it should have been. I rode along in winds that had become unpredictabile enjoying the tailwinds and cursing the headwinds. At one point a massive bug (cicada?) Smashed into my windpipe at high speed hard enough that I felt it for the next few miles. It surprised the crap out of me.   
I turned south and rode for just a few miles. Along this stretch I was chased by the cutest dog, he was a Chihuahua and chased me then just got scared and ran away. I kept going and then made the final turn into Pittsburg. I took my only photo of the day in a pretty little grove of trees.

I got into town and headed for the bike shop. Unfortunately it's closed Mondays. I'll need to go back tomorrow. I went to a bbq place for lunch (Ribcrib) and it was pretty good. The guy at the next table, John, asked me about my ride and I told him. We chatted on and off about Kansas and dogs: he's a hunting dog trainer. At the end of his meal he paid for my meal! I thanked him and asked him what he recommended around town. He gave me the names of a few restaurants, including an ice cream place in town and said he'd be there at 7 that night and that I could meet him if I liked. I said I would then said goodbye.   
I got checked in at my hotel (Holiday Inn) and immediately took a huge nap. When I woke up it was 5 so I took a shower, got some of still wet gear dried out then got changed to head to the ice cream place, Braums. I went over there, riding through town but didn't see John. I got a burger and banana split, which John had said can't be missed. He was right, it was great, but I was sad I didn't see him.  
I took a side street back to my hotel and enjoyed the sound of the bugs in the evening shade and cool temperatures. Morning and evening are when Kansas shine.   
I'm going to go do laundry and hit up the hotel hot tub. Cannot wait for that. Night!
